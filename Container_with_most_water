\* Leet code problem NO.11
You are given an integer array height of length n. There are n vertical lines drawn such that the two endpoints of the ith line are (i, 0) and (i, height[i]).
*Find two lines that together with the x-axis form a container, such that the container contains the most water.
*Return the maximum amount of water a container can store.
*Input: height = [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]
*Output: 49
*Explanation: The above vertical lines are represented by array [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7].
*In this case, the max area of water (blue section) the container can contain is 49.
